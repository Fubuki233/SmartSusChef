  # --- DEPLOYMENT JOB ---
  # This is a template for deploying to a Virtual Machine using docker-compose over SSH.
  # You will need to adapt this to your specific hosting environment.
  # Common alternatives:
  #   - Kubernetes: Use `kubectl apply` or a GitOps tool like ArgoCD/Flux.
  #   - PaaS (Azure App Service, AWS Elastic Beanstalk): Use the provider's official GitHub Action.
